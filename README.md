# Swerver
Server framework for Swift

This repo will be the starting ground for ideas/contribs

#Design Goals
* Ensure this framework can still run on mobile device, so that the same server infrastructure could run on a mobile device, and then support server-server communication using websockets for integration to a back-end platform
